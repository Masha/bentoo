# Vendored dependency tree, generated with `go mod vendor` and hosted by the

# Upstream publishes GitHub releases only up to v1.1.4 while tagging every
# version since; v1.8.0 is a tag with no release. Probing releases/latest here
# would pin a January 2025 version that PANICS on Go 1.27 sources, because its
# golang.org/x/tools (v0.29.0) predates the current AST. Probe the tags.
BDEPEND=">=dev-lang/go-1.26"

# The test suite compares against a live vulnerability database and needs
# network access plus fixed toolchain output.
RESTRICT="test"

# govulncheck names itself from debug.ReadBuildInfo(), which only carries a
# version when the binary was `go install`ed from the module proxy. Built from
# a tarball it reads "(devel)" and the VCS fallback finds no git checkout, so
# the scanner calls itself govulncheck@v0.0.0 -- in output people paste into
# reports. The patch short-circuits that fallback.
