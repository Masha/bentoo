# Kernel 7.1 gained native MT6639 Bluetooth, so from there the btusb/btmtk
# rebuild adds exactly one thing -- the HP EliteMini ID 0489:e156, which is not
# upstream -- while replacing the in-tree Bluetooth stack for every device on
# the machine. Upstream stopped building it by default in 2.14-6 for that
# reason; here it is a USE flag, off by default, so owners of an 0489:e156
# adapter opt in and nobody else pays for it. The ID has to appear in the
# driver's own btmtk_mt6639_devs[] table, so a `new_id` write is not a
# substitute for the module.
#
# The flag is named after the module, not "bluetooth": that one is a GLOBAL
# Gentoo USE flag enabled by most desktop profiles, so it would have turned this
# opt-in into an opt-out on exactly the systems that gain nothing from it.
