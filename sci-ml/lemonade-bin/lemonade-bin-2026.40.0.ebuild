# HYBRID PACKAGING -- DO NOT "SIMPLIFY" THIS ON A VERSION BUMP.
#
# 1) Why the binaries come from the "embeddable" tarball and NOT from the .deb:
#
#    1a) THE REASON THAT OUTLIVES THE SONAMES -- the .deb's lemond links
#    libsystemd.so.0.  Measured 2026-08-08 on the 11.5.2 payload:
#       readelf -dW <deb>/usr/bin/lemond | grep NEEDED
#          libsystemd.so.0  libcap.so.2  libcpp-httplib.so.0.41  ...
#       imports: sd_bus_open_system sd_bus_call_method sd_bus_message_read
#                sd_bus_message_unref sd_bus_error_free sd_bus_unref
#                sd_pid_get_unit
#    DT_NEEDED is a hard load-time requirement, so that binary does not even
#    start on a host without systemd's libraries -- it merges cleanly, passes
#    QA, and then fails at exec on an OpenRC box.  That is the exact failure
#    sci-biology/foldingathome hit between 8.5.5 and 8.5.6.  The embeddable
#    lemond links neither libsystemd nor libcap (same command, same day).
#    This is listed FIRST because the soname reasons below are fixable --
#    someone could package cpp-httplib 0.41 -- and this one is not.  If a
#    future bump makes the .deb payload look tempting again, re-run the readelf
#    above before touching src_install.
#
#    1b) Debian-13 sonames.  Upstream's .deb (and the Fedora RPMs) link against
#    sonames that do not exist on Gentoo:
#       libcpp-httplib.so.0.41  -- Gentoo builds cpp-httplib as .so.0.50.1
#       libwebsockets.so.19     -- Gentoo ships libwebsockets.so.21
#       libmbedcrypto.so.16     -- Gentoo installs this as libmbedcrypto-3.so.16
#    The "embeddable" tarball links those statically and only needs libraries
#    Gentoo provides under the very same soname (verified with readelf -d):
#       libz.so.1 libzstd.so.1 libssl.so.3 libcrypto.so.3 libdrm_amdgpu.so.1
#       libstdc++.so.6 libm.so.6 libgcc_s.so.1 libc.so.6
#
# 2) Why the .deb is still fetched (unconditionally, amd64 flavour only):
#    Only *arch-independent data* is taken out of it -- never an ELF object.
#    The embeddable tarball omits the web UI, the JSON schemas, the examples,
#    the man pages, the systemd units and architecture_defaults.json.  Those
#    files carry no machine code, so the amd64 .deb serves every arch and can
#    stay outside the SRC_URI USE-conditionals.
#    The six resources/*.json present in BOTH archives were verified
#    byte-identical for 11.5.0 (backend_versions, bench_scenarios, defaults,
#    server_models, toolDefinitions, vllm_model_config), so the .deb copy is
#    used for the whole resources/ tree -- it is a strict superset of the
#    tarball's.  Re-check that with cmp before trusting it on the next bump.
#
# 3) Why the ELF payload lives in /usr/$(get_libdir)/lemonade-server and NOT
#    directly in /usr/bin:
#    The embeddable build resolves its data files as <dirname /proc/self/exe>/
#    resources/ ONLY.  Unlike the .deb build it has no /usr/share/lemonade-server
#    fallback compiled in -- grep both binaries: that string is present in the
#    .deb one and absent from the embeddable one.  Installed straight into
#    /usr/bin it dies at startup with
#       Error: Failed to open /usr/bin/resources/defaults.json
#    So the real executables sit next to a "resources" symlink pointing at the
#    arch-independent tree under /usr/share/lemonade-server, and /usr/bin only
#    carries symlinks (/proc/self/exe resolves through them to the real path,
#    so the lookup still lands in the right directory).

	# --- service files -----------------------------------------------------
	# One service per scope, mirroring the two units upstream ships.  Both are
	# installed UNCONDITIONALLY: an init script costs a systemd user nothing,
	# while gating it would leave an OpenRC user with no way to run the daemon.
	# Only the units are gated by USE=systemd.
	#
	# The system pair is byte-identical to sci-ml/lemonade's -- same
	# /usr/bin/lemond, same acct-user/lemonade -- because FILESDIR is
	# per-package and the file cannot be shared.  Keep them in sync.
	#
	# An earlier revision claimed no OpenRC service was possible here because
	# the units use StateDirectory and AmbientCapabilities.  That was wrong on
	# both counts: StateDirectory/RuntimeDirectory map onto `checkpath -d` in
	# start_pre(), which lemond.initd already does, and OpenRC does have a
	# `capabilities` variable (supervise-daemon --capabilities).
	#
	# CAP_SYS_RESOURCE is deliberately NOT set, and that is now a measurement
	# rather than a preference.  Run 2026-08-08: lemond started with zero
	# capabilities and RLIMIT_MEMLOCK soft = hard = 8 MiB, bound its HTTP and
	# WebSocket servers and built its 114-entry model cache, with no capability,
	# rlimit or memlock diagnostic.  Upstream's own systemd USER unit ships with
	# no AmbientCapabilities at all over the same ExecStart, so upstream already
	# runs this daemon without it in one of its two scopes.  The binary does
	# call setrlimit, so the capability is not decorative upstream -- it is what
	# would permit raising a HARD limit -- but the only memlock diagnostics in
	# it (memlock_ok, "Memlock limits are too low.") sit in an NPU-readiness
	# block next to npu_driver_ok and "NPU validation failed.", i.e. they report
	# a condition rather than gate startup.
	# NOT covered: the test host has no NPU, so that probe was never reached.
	# On a Ryzen AI box with a restrictive memlock ceiling the OpenRC answer is
	# an admin knob -- rc_ulimit="-l unlimited" in /etc/conf.d/lemond, or
	# /etc/security/limits.conf -- not a capability in this file.
