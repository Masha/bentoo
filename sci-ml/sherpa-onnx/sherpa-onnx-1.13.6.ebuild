# THE OVERLAY'S REFERENCE ANSWER TO CMake FetchContent.
#
# Upstream's build declares every vendored dependency through FetchContent,
# which fetches at *configure* time — inside the sandbox, with no network. The
# defeat is not a patch: each of upstream's cmake/*.cmake modules checks a
# `possible_file_locations` list before reaching for the network, and that list
# includes ${CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR}. So the archives are declared here in SRC_URI,
# left archived, and copied into ${S} by src_unpack; configure then finds them
# locally and never opens a socket.
#
# Three properties make this work, and all three are load-bearing:
#   - The filenames must match what the cmake modules look for, which is why
#     every entry carries an explicit `->` rename. A renamed-wrong distfile is
#     not an error, it is a silent fallback to the network.
#   - .zip stays .zip. Upstream ships kissfft, websocketpp, piper-phonemize and
#     espeak-ng as .zip and its modules name them that way; converting to
#     .tar.gz would miss the fallback. This is what BDEPEND=app-arch/unzip is
#     for — CMake extracts them at configure time.
#
#     pkgcheck reports TarballAvailable on those four, suggesting the .tar.gz
#     equivalents. DO NOT act on it: it is a false positive here, and acting on
#     it silently restores the network fetch this whole block exists to remove.
#     Verified against the 1.13.5 sources — cmake/websocketpp.cmake,
#     cmake/piper-phonemize.cmake and cmake/espeak-ng-for-piper.cmake each build
#     a `possible_file_locations` list containing the literal .zip filename
#     under ${CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR} and fall through to `_URL` (the network) when no
#     entry EXISTS. The name is matched verbatim; a .tar.gz sitting beside it
#     does not satisfy the check. kissfft has no module of its own — it is
#     pulled by cmake/kaldi-native-fbank.cmake through the same mechanism.
#   - Sub-dependencies resolve through the same global ${CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR}
#     fallback (kissfft is pulled by kaldi-native-fbank, kaldifst by
#     kaldi-decoder), so one staging directory covers the whole tree.
#
# Every entry is pinned by tag or by full commit SHA. Do not relax one to a
# branch: FetchContent would then resolve to whatever HEAD happens to be.

# arm64 is deliberately not keyworded, and the omission is not about upstream.
#
# Upstream does publish aarch64 and armv7l wheels, which is real evidence and
# would normally be enough under this overlay's arm64 policy. But the ebuild's
# own build path has never been exercised on arm64: it compiles a large C++
# tree plus eleven vendored dependencies, and it links against
# sci-libs/onnxruntime, which is itself ~amd64 here. Keywording ~arm64 would
# assert an arm64 build nobody has run, against a dependency that has no arm64
# keyword to satisfy it.
#
# This matches the decision taken across the ggml family on 2026-08-08 and
# 2026-08-16: sci-ml/{llama-cpp,whisper-cpp,stable-diffusion-cpp,ik_llama-cpp,
# koboldcpp} are all ~amd64 for the same reason.
#
# Restore ~arm64 when sci-libs/onnxruntime carries it AND a recorded arm64
# build of this package exists. Upstream wheels alone are not the missing
# piece; they were never in doubt.

# would hide real defects in output this ebuild is responsible for.

# If a future version genuinely ships a prebuilt blob, scope QA_PREBUILT to
# that one path and say which file and why — never to the whole lib directory.
