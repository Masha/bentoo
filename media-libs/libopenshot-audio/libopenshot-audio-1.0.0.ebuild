DESCRIPTION="JUCE-based audio library used by libopenshot"

# JUCE is vendored in JuceLibraryCode/ upstream; there is no usable system JUCE
# to unbundle against, so it is deliberately built from the bundled copy.

src_prepare() {
	# Vendored Android Oboe subproject. It is never add_subdirectory()'d -- the
	# only add_subdirectory in this build is "src" -- and only its *.h files are
	# installed, so this CMakeLists.txt is dead weight in the tarball. But
	# cmake.eclass scans every CMakeLists.txt under ${S}, finds its
	# cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.4.1), and reacts by passing
	# -DCMAKE_POLICY_VERSION_MINIMUM=3.5 to the *whole* build. The top-level
	# range 3.1...3.20 is accepted by CMake 4 as-is (the range's max is what
	# satisfies it), so that global policy override buys nothing here and would
	# mask exactly the kind of policy incompatibility we want to fail loudly.
	# Drop the dead file instead. It must happen before cmake_src_prepare,
	# because the scan runs inside it. rm dies if upstream ever removes the
	# file, so a version bump cannot silently turn this into a no-op.
