	# The exact commit the published tarball was generated from.  This is the
	# pin, and it is not decoration: `HEAD` moves, so a recipe written in terms
	# of it yields different bytes under the same filename on a different day.
	# ${PV} is itself derived from this commit --
	# `git describe ${GN_COMMIT} --abbrev=12 --match initial-commit` gives
	# initial-commit-2501-g3fd3b0624d8c, hence 0.2501.

	# Upstream publishes commits, never releases, so somebody has to package a
	# snapshot.  ::gentoo does that on deps.gentoo.zip, which means its mirror
	# only ever carries the version ::gentoo itself is on -- this overlay would
	# be pinned to whatever the distribution shipped.  So the archive is
	# generated and hosted here instead.  The recipe below was proven
	# byte-identical against the 0.2374 tarball deps.gentoo.zip publishes, and
	# again against the 0.2501 tarball this overlay itself publishes:
	#
	#   git clone https://gn.googlesource.com/gn && cd gn
	#   git archive --format=tar --prefix=gn-${PV}/ ${GN_COMMIT} \
	#     | xz -9e > gn-${PV}.tar.xz
	#
	# and uploaded to distfiles.obentoo.org.  A bump is therefore never a plain
	# PV swap: the tarball must be generated and published first, which is why
	# the autoupdate record for this package carries hold = true.
