DESCRIPTION="Cline, an autonomous AI coding agent for the terminal"
HOMEPAGE="https://cline.bot/ https://github.com/cline/cline"
# The GitHub releases only carry the macOS/Windows desktop app, so the Linux
# build is fetched from the npm registry instead. Upstream splits it per
# platform behind optionalDependencies of the "cline" wrapper package; those
# per-platform packages are the actual payload and are what is pinned here.
