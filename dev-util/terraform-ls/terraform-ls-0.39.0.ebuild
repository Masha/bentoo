# the build needs no network and stays inside the sandbox.

# Upstream release builds embed the schemas of every official and partner
# provider, produced by `go generate ./internal/schemas`, which downloads
# terraform plus hundreds of providers. That cannot run in the sandbox, so this
# build embeds none: completion for provider blocks comes from the schemas of
# initialized modules (`terraform init`), read through the terraform CLI.
# The Algolia registry-search keys upstream injects with -X are secrets of their
# CI and stay empty, which disables registry module search.
