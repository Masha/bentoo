DESCRIPTION="Gemini CLI, Google's terminal AI agent"
HOMEPAGE="https://google-gemini.github.io/gemini-cli/ https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli"
# GitHub publishes no Linux artefact for this; upstream distributes through npm
# only. The tarball is a self-contained JavaScript bundle, not a wrapper that
# downloads a platform binary.

# Pure JavaScript: nothing here is architecture-specific, so this is not
# restricted to the two arches the prebuilt packages in this overlay carry.
