DESCRIPTION="PHP completion, refactoring and introspection tool and language server"
HOMEPAGE="https://phpactor.readthedocs.io/ https://github.com/phpactor/phpactor"
# The release asset is a Humbug Box phar with every Composer dependency
# inside it, so nothing is fetched at build time.
SRC_URI="https://github.com/phpactor/phpactor/releases/download/${PV}/${PN}.phar -> ${P}.phar"
S="${WORKDIR}"

# phpactor itself is MIT; the phar also carries jetbrains/phpstorm-stubs
# (Apache-2.0) and twig/twig, sebastian/diff, phpactor/phly-event-dispatcher
# (BSD-3-Clause). Everything else bundled is MIT (upstream composer.lock).
LICENSE="MIT Apache-2.0 BSD"
SLOT="0"
# A phar is PHP code, not architecture-specific.
KEYWORDS="~amd64 ~arm64"

# The phar runs Box's requirement checker before phpactor itself and aborts
# unless every extension it lists is loaded:
#   zlib      - every file in the phar is gzip-compressed
#   posix, tokenizer          - phpactor (composer.json ext-*)
#   filter, iconv, ssl(openssl) - amphp/dns, polyfill-mbstring, amphp/socket
# unicode (ext-mbstring) is not checked by Box, because the phar bundles
# symfony/polyfill-mbstring, but composer.json requires it, so it is kept.
# json and date are always built into PHP 8.
