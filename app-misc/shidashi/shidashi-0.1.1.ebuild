DESCRIPTION="Builds Bentoo (Gentoo stage5) images and live ISOs from a stage3"
HOMEPAGE="https://github.com/obentoo/shidashi"
SRC_URI="https://github.com/obentoo/${PN}/archive/refs/tags/v${PV}.tar.gz -> ${P}.tar.gz"

# amd64 only: Shidashi runs amd64 stage3s in systemd-nspawn on the host itself
# and its arch axis is x86-64 only (v3, znver5, arrowlake), so an arm64 host
# cannot run a build -- upstream does not support it.
KEYWORDS="~amd64"
IUSE="vm"

# Always: systemd-nspawn runs every build stage (and systemd-ssh-proxy reaches
# the VM), gpg verifies the stage3 and the ::gentoo snapshot, git fetches the
# pinned overlays, openssl hashes the live user's password, binutils' objdump
# checks the image's ISA. Portage runs inside the containers, and the ISO tools
# (grub, xorriso, mtools, squashfs-tools) inside the toolbox stage -- none of
# them is needed on the host. `shidashi doctor` checks the same list.
# sys-apps/systemd is a hard dependency on purpose: nspawn has no standalone
# package, so a host without systemd (split-usr, musl profiles) cannot build.
