# Report where every bentoo package diverges from its ::gentoo counterpart.
#
# WHAT IT IS FOR
#
# An overlay that shadows ::gentoo accumulates silent drift: a package is forked
# for one reason, ::gentoo later ships the same fix, and the overlay copy stays
# behind forever because nothing ever compares the two. This script is that
# missing comparison. It reads the metadata of both trees, names every axis on
# which they differ, and writes the result to a report a human can act on.
#
# STRICTLY READ-ONLY
#
# It reads two package trees and writes two report files under .epic/. It never
# writes inside a package directory, never touches ::gentoo, and never runs git.
# A parity check that edits what it is measuring is not a measurement.
#
# USAGE
#
#   bash scripts/gentoo-parity.sh                    # full sweep, writes the reports
#   bash scripts/gentoo-parity.sh kde-plasma         # restrict to one category
#   bash scripts/gentoo-parity.sh kde-plasma/kwin    # restrict to one package
#   bash scripts/gentoo-parity.sh --self-test        # assertions only, no report
#
#   GENTOO_REPO=<path>   the ::gentoo tree to compare against
#                        (default /var/db/repos/gentoo)
#   PARITY_REPORT_DIR=<path>
#                        where the two reports are written
#                        (default .epic/reports/gentoo-parity)
#
# Exit status:
#   0  the sweep found nothing to act on, or every self-test assertion passed
#   1  an ALIGN or UNDOCUMENTED divergence was found, or a self-test assertion
#      failed. JUSTIFIED and REDUNDANT do not fail the run: the first is a
#      decision already recorded, the second is remediation tracked elsewhere
#   2  a precondition or a usage error - nothing was compared

### versions #########################################################
#
# Everything the baseline selector needs to know about a version string, and
# nothing else. A version here is always the part of PF after "<pn>-", so it
# carries the revision too: 2.46.1-r1, not 2.46.1.

# version_is_live <version>
# Whether the version marks a VCS ebuild rather than a release.
#
# This is the single most consequential predicate in the script. Live versions
# sort above every real one, and a first pass that let them into the version
# sort reported 34 packages as behind ::gentoo when none are (design.md).
#
# It matches more than the bare 9999 and 99999999 that R2.4 names, because
# ::gentoo also ships per-branch live ebuilds - sys-devel/binutils-2.46.9999
# and media-gfx/blender-{4.5,5.0}.9999 are in the shared set today - and those
# are live by exactly the same convention. Measured 2026-08-06: matching the
# two literal forms only would hand blender-5.2.0 the baseline 5.0.9999 and
# binutils-2.47 the baseline 2.46.9999, so two ebuilds would be compared
# against a git checkout's metadata. Widening the rule changes those two
# baselines to 5.0.0 and 2.46.1-r1 and moves no other row: the exact /
# same-series / cross-series split is the same either way. That split was
# 76 / 33 / 210 when it was first measured and is 76 / 33 / 212 now, the two
# extra ebuilds being the ones 05b58fec5 added to the shared set (see A01) -
# neither of them live, and neither of them a counter-example.
version_is_live() {
	# Read as: an optional dotted prefix, then a component of nothing but 9s,
	# then an optional revision, then end. So 9999, 99999999, 9999-r1 and
	# 2.46.9999 are live and 2.46.1-r1 is not.

### pipeline #########################################################
#
# One function per stage, in execution order, each an obvious seam.
#
# While the stages were being filled in one at a time, each unimplemented one
# registered itself as pending and the sweep exited 3 rather than 0, so that a
# skeleton run could never be mistaken for a clean tree. All seven are
# implemented now, so that scaffolding is gone and the exit contract in
# sweep_exit_code is the real one.

### what the stages publish ##########################################
#
# The pipeline's entire output surface. A stage writes here; nothing reads a
# stage's internals. That is what lets the self-test assert on results rather
# than re-deriving them - an assertion that walked the two trees itself would
# still be green with every stage below deleted, and would be testing coreutils
# instead of this script.
#
# Each one stays empty until the stage named beside it is implemented, which is
# why an assertion reading it is red until then. Stages 1 to 3 are filled in;
# the six assertions that read stages 4 to 6 are still red, and correctly so.

# Story 008 adds two more, and both are OUTPUT SURFACE rather than internals for
# the same reason as everything above: an assertion has to read what a stage
# concluded, not re-derive it.
#
# They are declared empty here rather than beside the logic that fills them so
# that the assertions reading them can be authored FIRST and fail by observing
# nothing recorded. Under set -u an assertion reading an undeclared array aborts
# the harness instead - which is a broken test, not a red one, and would prove

#
# WHY THIS AXIS NEEDED ITS OWN COMPARATOR. Ten of the sixteen SLOT rows story
# 007 produced differ only because the package encodes its version in the slot
# or the subslot - dev-db/redis at 0/8.10 against 0/8.8, dev-lang/lua at 5.5
# against 5.4. That is the same artifact story 007's own R1.4 already gates
# dependency bounds against; SLOT was simply never given the same treatment, and
# an inventory whose rows are mostly artifacts trains its reader to skim.
#
# THE COUNT IS COMPARED FIRST, AND THE ORDER IS LOAD-BEARING. net-libs/nodejs
# declares SLOT="24" where ::gentoo declares "0/24": the overlay drops the
# subslot entirely, so a := dependency on it cannot trigger a rebuild when the
# ABI changes. It is the most valuable single finding the 007 sweep produced.
# Both sides normalise to a placeholder-bearing form, so comparing the
# normalised forms without checking the component count first calls them
# identical and deletes the finding while looking like a success.
#
# ONLY DIFFERING COMPONENTS ARE TESTED FOR DERIVABILITY, which is R1.4 read

### the axes md5-cache does not carry #################################
#
# Stage 4 compared what egencache wrote down. Three things it never writes down
# still decide whether two copies of a package behave the same: the metadata.xml
# beside the ebuild, whatever sits under files/, and the PATCHES array in the
# ebuild text. Parity claimed on md5-cache alone is parity claimed on one file
# per package.
#
# A fourth, _eclasses_, IS in md5-cache but is not about the ebuild: it records
# which eclass CONTENT the entry was generated against, so it reads a
# repository-wide fact off a per-package entry (R4.3). Stage 4's header says it
# was left for here; this is here.

# The two positional columns a package-level row has no version to put in.
# metadata.xml and files/ belong to the package DIRECTORY, not to any one of the
# ebuilds in it, so there is no overlay PV and no baseline PV to name. They
# cannot simply be left empty: a tab is IFS whitespace, so an empty column in the
# middle of a row is swallowed and shifts every column after it when the row is
# read back. The distance column gets its own value rather than borrowing one of
# stage 2's three, because "exact" on a row that compares no versions would be a
# claim the row is not making.
PACKAGE_ROW_PV='(package)'
PACKAGE_ROW_DISTANCE='package'

# THE TWO AXES WITH NO JUSTIFICATION MECHANISM (R4.4)
#
# Every axis stage 4 emits lives in an ebuild, so a divergence on it can be
# justified where it is: sub-task 5.2's parser reads a "# BENTOO-DIVERGENCE:
# <axis>" comment out of the ebuild that carries the divergence. metadata.xml
# and files/ have no such ebuild. The difference is in a file holding no bash,
# sitting beside N ebuilds none of which owns it, so there is nowhere to put the
# tag and no rule that would pick which of the N should carry it.
#
# Decided at the Phase 1 gate and deliberately NOT worked around here: this
# inventory measures the volume first. If it is low no mechanism is needed, and
# if it is high the shape of the data decides what the mechanism should be -
# rather than a guess made before the data existed.
#
# The consequence is that every row on these axes reaches the report as ALIGN
# and can never be anything else. R3.1 requires exactly one of the four verdicts
# on every divergence, so "no verdict" was never available; what these axes lack
# is the EVIDENCE that promotes one. ALIGN there therefore means something
# weaker than ALIGN elsewhere - not "no reason was recorded" but "no reason
# COULD be recorded" - and nothing in the row itself distinguishes the two. So
# the report says which it is, and it says it IN PLACE.
#
# HOW SUB-TASK 6.2 CONSUMES THIS. parity-report.md groups rows by axis. For each
# section whose axis appears in PARITY_UNJUSTIFIABLE_AXES, print
# PARITY_UNJUSTIFIABLE_NOTE directly under that section's heading - not once at
# the foot of the report. The reader this is for is the one who skims to the
# files/ section and stops there; a footnote is read by whoever already knew.
# Sub-task 5.2 wants the same list for the opposite reason: a row on one of
# these axes must not be promoted to UNDOCUMENTED for lacking a tag it cannot
# carry. Both consume the array, so neither has to restate the list of axes.
# files/overlay-only and files/gentoo-only WERE here until 2026-09-06. They are
# no longer emitted at all: the first is partitioned into a suppression and the
# new files/unreferenced axis, the second is suppressed whole. See the files
# stage for the measurement that justified it.
#
# WHAT THIS LIST MEANS CHANGED ON 2026-09-06, and the old reading was a mistake
# worth recording. It used to be "these rows can never be JUSTIFIED either",
# argued from "the file holds no ebuild code, so it cannot carry a tag". That
# confuses WHERE THE DIFFERENCE IS with WHERE THE REASON CAN BE WRITTEN. A patch
# under files/ exists because an ebuild applies it, and a metadata.xml describes
# a package whose ebuilds are right there; the ebuild is the natural place for
# the reason, and collect_tags now registers a package-level key so a tag can
# reach these rows.
#
# The old reading had a cost. Every row on these two axes was ALIGN FOREVER, by
# construction, however deliberate the divergence - chromium's patched
# bin-finder.py, open-vm-tools' overlay-only init script, thirteen zed USE flags
# ::gentoo does not have. Eleven permanently red rows in a guard is how a guard
# becomes one people stop reading.
#
# What the list still does, and correctly: it keeps these axes from being
# promoted to UNDOCUMENTED. That verdict means "somebody added this to the
# overlay and recorded no reason", and it is a claim about ebuild content that
# a file-level difference cannot support.

# Patterns NO ebuild text names -- an eclass reads them straight out of

# reference whose target has to exist. A package that inherits the eclass and
# has no README.gentoo is not broken.
FILESDIR_REFS_ECLASS=""

# filesdir_refs <repo root> <category/pn>
# Every files/ name the package's ebuilds reach through ${FILESDIR}, into
# FILESDIR_REFS as a space-separated list of GLOB patterns.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS. Measured on 2026-09-06: 62 of 66 files/overlay-only names and
# 123 of 132 files/gentoo-only names are reached from an ebuild in their own
# package. So neither axis measures an independent divergence - both are shadows
# of PATCHES and the phase functions, which already carry a
# # BENTOO-DIVERGENCE: tag. Reporting them as ALIGN made half of all ALIGN rows
# noise that no action could ever clear.
#
# THREE WAYS TO GET THIS WRONG, all of them hit before this was right:
#   - a row's value is a SPACE-SEPARATED LIST of names, not one name;
#   - ebuilds name patches through interpolation (${P}-nettle-4.patch), so
#     matching the literal filename under-counts badly;
#   - "${FILESDIR}"/x puts a quote BETWEEN the variable and the path, so a
#     pattern that stops at the quote sees a bare ${FILESDIR} and misses the
#     reference entirely.
# Hence: read the expression past an optional quote, expand PN/P/PV/PF, and turn
# any remaining ${VAR} into a wildcard rather than guessing its value.
# expand_braces <string>
# One level of brace expansion, space separated. Bash does this for a literal
# but NOT for the contents of a variable, and eval on text lifted out of an
# ebuild is not a trade worth making.
#
# WHY IT IS NEEDED. Three ebuilds reference files this way today -
# flatpak-update.{service,timer}, rustdesk{,-link}.desktop and
# {50-${PN},wrapper.in} - and without expansion the reference matches nothing,
# so six files in active use were reported as orphans. That is the worst kind of
# false positive here: it invites someone to delete a file the build needs.
#
# The empty element matters: rustdesk{,-link} means rustdesk.desktop AND
# rustdesk-link.desktop, so the split has to preserve an empty field, which is
# why this reads with IFS into an array rather than looping over an unquoted
# expansion.

# Sub-task 4.3. Eclasses whose recorded hash differs between the two trees.
#
# R1.6, AND WHY THE LOCAL LIST IS READ FROM A DIRECTORY. An eclass the overlay
# ships is resolved from the overlay for every overlay ebuild that inherits it,
# so the hash in the overlay's md5-cache is the hash of the OVERLAY's copy and
# differs from ::gentoo's by construction. Reporting that would be reporting the
# decision to ship a copy, not a consequence of it, so those are recorded as
# definitionally divergent in PARITY_ECLASS_DEFINITIONAL instead.
#
# The list comes from eclass/*.eclass rather than from three names written here,
# and the difference is not cosmetic. Two of the three - gstreamer-meson and rpm
# - shadow a ::gentoo eclass and would be findable from the data. brave has no
# ::gentoo counterpart at all AND is inherited only by www-client/brave-browser,
# which ::gentoo does not carry, so it is not in the shared set and never
# reaches this comparison. Built from observations it would silently not be
# recorded; built from the directory it is recorded, with its inheritor count
# reading 0 and saying exactly why.
#
# Membership is not compared here. An eclass present on one side only is the
# INHERIT axis's finding when it is inherited directly, and the mechanical
# consequence of a hash that already has its own row when it is transitive.
# R4.3 is about an eclass whose CONTENT differs, which is the intersection.
#
# STORY 008: THIS AXIS NO LONGER EMITS A DIVERGENCE ROW, AND THAT IS EXHAUSTIVE
# RATHER THAN A LOSS. Every differing hash falls into one of exactly two cases,
# and neither is drift in the tree:
#
#   the overlay SHIPS the eclass    the two trees hashed two different files,
#                                   so they differ by construction. Story 007's
#                                   R1.6 already recorded these as definitional
#
#   the overlay does NOT ship it    then BOTH trees resolved the same ::gentoo
#                                   file, so the hashes cannot describe
#                                   different content - only different moments.
#                                   The overlay's md5-cache is out of date.
#                                   Story 008's R2.1: a stale cache
#
# There is no third case, which is why the row-emitting path was removed rather
# than left unreachable. Story 008's R2.5 - "keep reporting a real finding where
# the overlay does carry the eclass" - is met by the first branch below keeping

#
# R3.2 makes ALIGN the default and R3.5 forbids inferring intent, so every row

#
#   REDUNDANT     the whole ebuild is byte-identical to its exact baseline
#   JUSTIFIED     a tag in the overlay ebuild names THIS axis
#   UNDOCUMENTED  the overlay carries something on this axis that ::gentoo does
#                 not, and no tag explains it
#   ALIGN         everything else
#
# THE UNDOCUMENTED RULE, STATED MECHANICALLY, because R3.5 forbids the other
# kind. A set-valued row carries each side's SURPLUS. An overlay surplus of
# (none) means the overlay adds nothing and is merely BEHIND - residue, which is
# ALIGN. An overlay surplus that is NOT (none) means somebody wrote that into
# the overlay ebuild: the divergence is an addition rather than a residue, and
# an addition with no tag is precisely what a human has to decide about.
#
# It is a criterion a reader can check, not a guess about why. It reproduces all
# four hand-inspected calibration cases in design.md:
#
#   kwin PYTHON_COMPAT        overlay surplus (none)     -> ALIGN
#   kdeplasma-addons INHERIT  overlay surplus (none)     -> ALIGN
#   plasma-desktop qtbase[X]  overlay surplus present    -> UNDOCUMENTED
#   spectacle PATCHES         overlay surplus present    -> UNDOCUMENTED untagged,
#                                                           JUSTIFIED once tagged
#
# Single-valued axes are EXCLUDED from the rule rather than fitted to it. Both
# sides always carry a value there, so "the overlay carries something ::gentoo
# does not" is true of every single one of them and separates nothing. They stay
# ALIGN - the honest default - instead of being promoted by a test that does not
# discriminate.
#
# Byte-identity is read from the TRACKED ebuild, never through
# resolve_overlay_ebuild. The self-test's scratch copy has a tag appended, so
# resolving through it would make a byte-identical ebuild look modified and
# quietly move the count off 67.

# src_uri_distfiles <SRC_URI value>
# The distfile NAMES a SRC_URI resolves to, one per line.
#
# This is deliberately a name extractor and not a SRC_URI parser. It walks the
# token stream and keeps only what portage would end up fetching into DISTDIR:
#
#   "a? ( ... )"  the conditional wrapper and its parens are structure, not
#                 files. Every branch is kept, because a Manifest must cover
#                 the distfiles of EVERY USE combination, not of this one.
#   "|| ( ... )"  same; any arm may be the one used.
#   "URL -> name" the arrow renames, so the DIST line carries `name`, not the
#                 basename of the URL. Missing this is how a rename-heavy
#                 package would report a false positive on every fetch.
#   "URL"         plain: the basename after the last slash.
#
# A token with no slash and no arrow is not a URL - it is a leftover operator

# It used to be dev-ruby/erb, the tree's only stale md5-cache entry when story
# 008 measured it. That worked exactly once. A stale cache is a TRANSIENT STATE
# of the tree, not a property of a package: on 2026-09-05 a remediation pass ran
# egencache, erb's ruby-fakegem hash caught up with ::gentoo's, and all three
# assertions went red having lost their subject - not because the rule broke,
# but because the tree stopped exhibiting it. Repinning on whichever entry is
# stale today only schedules the same failure for the next egencache run.
#
# So the fixture manufactures the state instead. prepare_stale_scratch writes a
# two-tree pair under $TMPDIR carrying BOTH cases the rule has to tell apart:
#
#   fixture-shared   an eclass the overlay does NOT ship, hashes differing.
#                    Both trees resolved the same ::gentoo file, so this can
#                    only be a stale cache - R2.1
#   fixture-local    an eclass the overlay DOES ship, hashes differing. A
#                    deliberate override, definitional - story 007's R1.6
#
# Neither can be regenerated away, and neither depends on what the overlay is
# carrying this week. The names are deliberately not real eclasses: a fixture

# dirname resolves to the fixture's scripts/, so a subprocess started through
# the symlink treats the fixture as its overlay and nothing else changes. There
# is no second copy of the script to drift from this one.
#
# WHAT EACH FILE IS FOR, because every one of them is load-bearing:
#
#   the two md5-cache entries  identical on every compared axis except
#                              _eclasses_, so the ONLY observation the run can
#                              make is the stale cache. That is R2.4's exact
#                              state and what lets A21 expect rows=0
#   the two ebuilds            differ by their comment line. Byte-identical
#                              ones would be classified REDUNDANT, which is a
#                              row, and rows=0 is the point

# prepare_verdict_scratch
# Extend the fixture trees with one package that exhibits all three verdicts
# assign_verdicts can reach without a byte-identical ebuild. Runs after
# prepare_stale_scratch and reuses its trees; a separate CATEGORY is what keeps
# the two apart, because fixture_pass and A21 both scope by one.
#
# HOW EACH VERDICT IS PRODUCED, and each is one line of md5-cache:
#
#   RDEPEND       only ::gentoo has it. The overlay's surplus is empty, so the
#                 overlay adds nothing and is merely BEHIND - residue, ALIGN
#   IUSE          only the overlay has it, and no tag names IUSE. Somebody put
#                 it there and no reason is recorded - UNDOCUMENTED
#   DEPEND        only the overlay has it, and a tag names DEPEND - JUSTIFIED
#   REQUIRED_USE  only the overlay has it and no tag names it either, so by the
#                 rule above it would be UNDOCUMENTED - except REQUIRED_USE is
#                 in PARITY_SINGLE_VALUED_AXES and can never be promoted. ALIGN
#
# WHY THE FIRST CASE IS RDEPEND AND NOT REQUIRED_USE, which is what it was for
# one draft. REQUIRED_USE cannot reach UNDOCUMENTED on ANY input, so asserting
# ALIGN on it proves nothing about the residue rule - a mutant that deleted the
# surplus test outright still passed. Found by mutation, not by reading.
#
# The same flaw was in BOTH of A08's previous subjects: kwin's PYTHON_COMPAT
# surfaced on a single-valued axis, and freecad's divergence IS REQUIRED_USE. So
# for its whole life this assertion was documented as guarding the residue rule
# while never once exercising it.
#
# The four cases differ only in the criterion each is meant to exercise. A case
# that differed on several things at once would stay green under a rule that
# read the wrong one - which is exactly what happened.

### the twelve assertions #############################################
#
# design.md's Testing Strategy table, executable. The numbers were measured by
# hand on 2026-08-05, re-measured on 2026-08-06, and four of them re-measured
# again later the same day after 05b58fec5 added three packages (see A01). A run
# that does not reproduce them is wrong, or the measurement is stale and gets
# RE-MEASURED and recorded - never loosened until it agrees.
#
# The overlay is bumped daily, so a scope count going stale is expected and is
# not a defect. What must never happen is a stale count being met by widening
# the assertion instead of explaining the delta.
#
# Each one increments ASSERT_TOTAL and appends to FAILURES on failure, so the
# verdict below stays as written:
#
#   assert_eq <id> <description> <expected> <actual>
#
# Two rules hold for all twelve:
#
#   READ THE PIPELINE, NOT THE TREES. Every observed value comes from what a
#   stage published. An assertion that counted the ebuilds itself would be
#   green with every stage deleted, which is worse than having no assertion.
#
#   NEVER PASS ON NOTHING. Where the expected value is 0, it is paired with a
#   denominator or with a signal known to exist, because "0 out of nothing" and
#   "0 out of 319" are otherwise the same string - and the first is the state
#   this script is in today. An assertion that goes green before the logic it
#   guards exists is a defect, not progress.

	# sys-apps/uutils-coreutils-bin, which it does not. So 232 + 2 = 234 shared,
	# 319 + 2 = 321 ebuilds and 82 + 1 = 83 overlay-only - every delta accounted
	# for by one commit, with 76 / 67 / 67 unmoved.
	#
	# Recorded rather than adjusted quietly, and never the other way round: an
	# assertion that disagrees with the tree is stale until the difference is

	# retires the only thing that would notice the overlay moving under it.
	# RE-MEASURED 2026-09-05, from 234 / 321 / 76, and the delta is one event:
	# the KDE Plasma line left the overlay. Between bd598cb4d and HEAD the tree
	# lost 82 packages and gained 30; 72 of the 82 are kde-plasma/*, and 81 of
	# them were packages ::gentoo also carries. 12 of the 30 added are shared.

	# of ::gentoo's copy at the same PV. It was a shared package (A01), holding a

	# SLOT rows differ only because the two sides sit at different versions
	# and the package puts its version in the slot or the subslot. Six are
	# structural and must survive.
	#
	# findings.md called it 14 and 2. It was wrong in both directions,
	# because it looked only past the "/": it counted imath and glslang as
	# noise when their subslots are real, and missed lua, blender and
	# binutils, which put the version in the slot itself.

	# The outcome as a whole, pinned by NAME. A13 alone would go green for a
	# rule that suppressed ten WRONG rows if it happened to name the right
	# survivors - which is why the four below pin the shapes individually.
	# RE-MEASURED 2026-09-05. Still six rows, but three of the names turned
	# over: webkit-gtk and chromium left the structural set and nettle and
	# libqmi entered it. Neither the count nor the rule moved - the two that
	# left are at PVs whose slots ::gentoo now matches, and the two that

	# MEASURED AGAINST A FIXTURE SINCE 2026-09-06, and the history is the whole

	# rows stopped being emitted when files/overlay-only was partitioned into a
	# suppression plus the new files/unreferenced axis, and files/gentoo-only
	# was suppressed whole. Both are recorded in PARITY_FILES_SUPPRESSED, so

	# this assertion guards is that the two halves move TOGETHER, and 268
	# against 268 is exactly as true as 338 against 338 was.
	#
	# RE-MEASURED SAME DAY, 268 -> 264, for two reasons that both belong to the
	# files/ work above. Two rows went because filesdir_refs was confusing PV
	# with PVR and reporting live patches as unreferenced (see the note there),
	# and two more because the files those rows named -- the only genuinely
	# dead ones -- were deleted from the tree.
	#
	# RE-MEASURED AGAIN, 264 -> 244, when metadata.xml got the same treatment
	# the files/ axes did: 20 of its 27 rows are a maintainer line that cannot
	# align or a USE flag description that follows its own side's IUSE. Both
	# are recorded in PARITY_METADATA_SUPPRESSED. The invariant holds again --
	# 244 against 244.
	#
	# RE-MEASURED 2026-09-06, 244 -> 245, and the delta is a single row that
	# came from the OTHER tree:
	#
	#     dev-util/vulkan-tools  PATCHES  (none) | vulkan-tools-1.4.357.0-libcxx-23.patch  ALIGN
	#
	# ::gentoo synced at 17:49 that day and added that patch to its 1.4.357.0,
	# which is the baseline the overlay's snapshot is compared against. No
	# bentoo commit is involved: diffing the 244-row report against a fresh
	# sweep shows every other line either unchanged or following a PV that was
	# bumped. Worth recording as its own kind of movement - the count drifts
	# when ::gentoo moves too, and a reader who only checks the overlay's log
	# will not find the cause there.
	#
	# The invariant is untouched: 245 against 245.
	#
	# RE-MEASURED 2026-09-06 (second pass), 245 -> 235, and this one is the
	# remediation itself rather than either tree moving. The gstreamer block was
	# audited package by package and 14 rows were closed:
	#
	#   -10  gst-plugins-base gained virtual/opengl, gst-python gained
	#        gst-plugins-bad, and gst-plugins-qt6 got the three deps the
	#        gstreamer-meson eclass used to put in its DEPEND back - three real
	#        lags, so the rows are gone rather than reclassified
	#    -4  gst-plugins-bad's missing !media-plugins/gst-plugins-va blocker
	#        turned out NOT to be a lag: ::gentoo removed that package and
	#        blocks leftovers, while bentoo still ships it and pulls it through
	#        PDEPEND. Tagged, so those four moved ALIGN -> JUSTIFIED and stay
	#        in the total
	#
	# EXPECT THIS ASSERTION TO MOVE ON EVERY REMEDIATION PASS. It pins the
	# absolute total, and closing a divergence is exactly what lowers it - the
	# number going down is the work succeeding. What must never move is the
	# equality of the two halves.
	#
	# RE-MEASURED 2026-09-06 (third pass), 235 -> 232, and it splits the same
	# way the gstreamer block did - two real lags fixed, two decisions recorded:
	#
	#    -3  libreoffice-l10n gained RPM_COMPRESS_TYPE=xz on both ebuilds, which
	#        widens BDEPEND back to ::gentoo's, and vulkan-tools got back the
	#        test? ( dev-cpp/gtest ) a pin rewrite had deleted
	#    +-0  lua's missing app-portage/elt-patches and foldingathome's missing
