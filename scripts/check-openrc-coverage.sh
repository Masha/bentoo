# Report every package that installs a systemd unit without the matching
# OpenRC init script.
#
# WHAT IT IS FOR
#
# bentoo targets OpenRC boxes as much as systemd ones, but nothing in the tree
# enforces that. A package can install a .service and no init script, pass
# pkgcheck, merge cleanly, and leave the daemon simply unstartable on an OpenRC
# host - a gap that only surfaces when a user tries to run the thing. This
# script is the missing check. It classifies every package on one dimension -
# does it install a unit, and if so does it install the OpenRC counterpart at
# the SAME SCOPE - and names each gap.
#
# The criterion, stated once:
#
#   a SYSTEM unit (/usr/lib/systemd/system) pairs with /etc/init.d
#   a USER   unit (/usr/lib/systemd/user)   pairs with /etc/user/init.d
#
# The two scopes carry different severities. A missing system init script is a
# FAIL and drives the exit code: system init scripts are universal in this tree
# and their absence is a plain defect. A missing user-scope script is a WARN,
# printed and counted but not fatal: the user-scope pattern has exactly one
# precedent here (sys-apps/xdg-desktop-portal) and NONE in ::gentoo, so failing
# a build over it would be asserting a convention that does not yet exist.
#
# STRICTLY READ-ONLY
#
# It reads ebuild text and prints a report. It writes no file, creates no
# directory, touches no Manifest or metadata, and never runs git, portage or a
# build. A guard that edits what it measures is not a measurement.
#
# HOW IT CLASSIFIES
#
# By reading the highest-version ebuild of each package - comments stripped and
# elog/ewarn prose skipped, since both talk about these calls without making
# them - and looking for four things:
#
#   1. the install functions, matched as whole words: systemd_dounit,
#      systemd_newunit, systemd_douserunit, systemd_newuserunit,
#      systemd_install_serviced, newinitd, doinitd
#   2. the unit directory handed to a build system, where no install call ever
#      names the unit: systemd_get_systemunitdir, systemdsystemunitdir,
#      SYSTEMD_SERVICES_INSTALL_DIR, systemd-user-unit-dir,
#      systemd_get_userunitdir
#   3. a user-scope script installed as a plain file: exeinto into
#      /etc/user/init.d, then doexe/newexe
#   4. the reviewed allowlist below - a policy exclusion, printed with its
#      reason, never a silent filter
#
# Classification is on the DESTINATION PATH, never on a filename. A vendor
# payload dumped under /opt can carry a .service file (app-backup/duplicati-bin,
# media-sound/audacity-bin, mail-client/betterbird-bin all do) and it is inert
# there, because systemd does not read /opt. Matching "*.service" as a filename
# would count those, and would also count D-Bus activation files, which are not
# units at all (kde-plasma/kameleon-qmk-helper ships one).
#
# WHY EBUILD TEXT AND NOT metadata/md5-cache OR A BUILD
#
# md5-cache was evaluated as the index and rejected: the entry for a package
# that demonstrably installs a unit (metadata/md5-cache/www-misc/warsaw-2.21.5.1)
# carries INHERIT, DEFINED_PHASES, RESTRICT, SRC_URI, LICENSE and KEYWORDS, and
# no field records an installed unit or init script. Building all 318 packages
# and inspecting ${D} would be exact, and a guard that needs 318 builds is not
# a guard.
#
# WHAT THIS STILL MISSES - stated here rather than discovered later
#
#   * a unit that appears only after an upstream bump changes the payload, or
#     that a meson/cmake default starts installing on its own. Text cannot see
#     either; only a build can.
#   * anything installed by a helper sourced from files/.
#   * prose that is not on an elog/ewarn line. A heredoc body - readme.gentoo's
#     DOC_CONTENTS is the usual one - can name newinitd in running text and be
#     read as an install. Measured: no heredoc in this tree does, and every
#     occurrence of a detected token today is a real call.
#   * an init script installed as a plain file via `exeinto /etc/init.d` plus
#     doexe. No package in this tree uses that idiom (measured: zero), so no
#     detector is carried for it; the user-scope twin exists because
#     sys-apps/xdg-desktop-portal actually does it.
#   * USE flags. A unit installed under `if use systemd` counts as installed,
#     because the question is whether the package CAN put a unit on disk with
#     no OpenRC counterpart - not whether one particular profile does.
#   * eclasses that install services on the package's behalf. Only
#     apache-2.eclass and nginx.eclass do this in ::gentoo and bentoo inherits
#     neither, so this is a checked non-concern rather than an assumption.
#
# The guard narrows the window. It does not close it.
#
# USAGE
#
#   bash scripts/check-openrc-coverage.sh                  # whole overlay
#   bash scripts/check-openrc-coverage.sh sci-ml           # one category
#   bash scripts/check-openrc-coverage.sh sci-ml/lemonade  # one package
#   bash scripts/check-openrc-coverage.sh --self-test      # assertions only
#   bash scripts/check-openrc-coverage.sh -h
#
# A row is printed when the package carries a finding, or whenever a filter was
# given. An unfiltered run is a guard: its job is to name gaps, and 300-odd
# PASS/n-a rows would bury the handful that matter. A filter is a question about
# named packages, and the answer has to be printed even when it is PASS. The
# summary counts every package scanned either way, so nothing is invisible.
#
# Exit status:
#   0  every selected package classified, no system-scope gap. Warnings may be
#      present: a user-scope gap is reported without failing the run
#   1  at least one system-scope gap
#   2  a precondition or a usage error, i.e. NOTHING WAS COMPARED. The third
#      code is the important one: an empty report reads exactly like a clean
#      one, and that confusion is what it exists to prevent

#
# A POLICY exclusion, and only that. It is never a place to put a package the

# each one is a decision someone made and signed, recorded with the reasoning
# that justified it.
#
# The counter-example is worth keeping in view. net-misc/rustdesk-bin LOOKS
# like a candidate - it does `cp -a etc usr "${ED}"/` and its payload contains
# a .service file - and it is not one. That .service sits at
# usr/share/rustdesk/files/systemd/, where systemd never looks, and the unit
# that really gets installed goes through an explicit systemd_dounit that pass 1
# already catches. Allowlisting it would suppress a package the classifier
# handles correctly AND make its genuine gap permanently unreportable.

### self test ########################################################
#
# design.md's Testing Strategy, executable: numbered assertions with PINNED
# expected values, each pin carrying a comment saying what to do when it goes
# stale. This is what proves the classifier is right - above all on the classes
# that fail SILENTLY, where a wrong answer still prints a plausible row and
# nobody looks twice:
#
#   * the init script or unit that arrives in the UPSTREAM PAYLOAD instead of
#     from FILESDIR - www-misc/warsaw has no files/ directory at all (A01)
#   * the unit a build system writes from a directory argument, with no install
#     call ever naming it - net-misc/networkmanager, sys-apps/xdg-desktop-portal
#     (A02, A03)
#   * the .service file that is inert because of WHERE it lands, not what it is
#     called - app-backup/duplicati-bin (A04)
#   * the package that installs an init script and no unit, whose verdict is
#     character-for-character identical to a package that installs neither -
#     sci-ml/lemonade (A05)
#
# Two rules hold for every assertion below. Both are borrowed from
# scripts/gentoo-parity.sh, which learned them the hard way:
#
#   READ THE CLASSIFIER, NOT THE TREE. Every observed value comes from a real
#   sweep() over the real overlay, or from a real subprocess run of this script.
#   An assertion that grepped the ebuild itself would stay green with the whole
#   classifier deleted, which is worse than having no assertion at all.
#
#   NEVER PASS ON NOTHING. Every package pin leads with rows=1, so a package
#   that was renamed or dropped reads as rows=0 rather than silently comparing
#   two empty strings. And every verdict pin carries the EVIDENCE beside it,
#   because "system=n/a user=n/a" is what a package installing nothing prints
#   AND what sci-ml/lemonade - an init script and no unit - prints. The verdicts
#   are identical; only the evidence separates them.
#
# The overlay is bumped daily, so a pin going stale is expected and is not a
# defect. What must never happen is a stale pin met by WIDENING the assertion
# instead of explaining the delta. Five pins below are expected to move during
# this story and say so; a pin that moves without its comment predicting it is a
# regression, and that is the rule Task 5.1 applies.
