# BENTOO-DIVERGENCE: PATCHES - one, where ::gentoo carries two.
#
# optional-gstreamer is deliberately absent and must stay absent: it invents a
# gstreamer USE flag upstream does not have, and this ebuild takes the
# dependency unconditionally as upstream declares it (see DEPEND below).
#
# sandbox-disable-failing-tests IS carried, rebased onto 1.22.1 and renamed
# version-agnostic - see the PATCHES block below. It was recorded as "does not
# apply, open" on 2026-09-07 and resolved the same day: their two hunks were
# reduced to one, because the trailing-newline fix they also carry is already
# upstream here.

# BENTOO-DIVERGENCE: IUSE - no gstreamer flag. That flag is not upstream's: it
# comes from ::gentoo's own 1.20.4-optional-gstreamer.patch, which this overlay
# does not carry. Here the dependency is what upstream makes it, unconditional -
# see media-libs/gst-plugins-base in DEPEND below.
#
# sys-apps/bubblewrap travels with it, and dropping the flag is exactly how it
# went missing. ::gentoo declares it TWICE -- once in that gstreamer? block and
# once in seccomp? -- so folding the block in unconditionally took the
# gst-plugins-base half and left the bwrap half behind, under a USE flag a user
# can turn off.
#
# It is not optional in practice. src/meson.build compiles the bwrap path into
# xdg-desktop-portal-validate-{icon,sound} as -DHELPER only `if bwrap.found()`,
# and both binaries are built and installed unconditionally. Without it the
# #ifdef HELPER vanishes and the validator runs validate_icon(fd) directly --
# still working, still installed, but parsing untrusted payloads with no
# sandbox at all. Nothing fails; the isolation is just gone.
#
# So it is declared unconditionally and the seccomp? copy is dropped as
# redundant rather than kept alongside.
