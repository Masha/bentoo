# PREBUILT PACKAGING NOTES -- READ BEFORE A VERSION BUMP.
#
# 1) Why a -bin at all, when ::gentoo already has sys-apps/uutils-coreutils:
#    the from-source ebuild pulls ~400 crates and a Rust toolchain.  Upstream
#    publishes official binaries for every release, so users who only want the
#    utilities (containers, edge boxes, arm64 SBCs, machines with no Rust)
#    should not have to compile them.  This package installs exactly the same
#    file layout as the from-source one, so the two are interchangeable.
#
# 2) Why musl builds on arm64/riscv but a glibc build on amd64/x86:
#    upstream ships NO aarch64-*-linux-gnu or riscv64-*-linux-gnu tarball --
#    only *-linux-musl, which is statically linked and therefore runs fine on
#    a glibc system.  On amd64/x86 the glibc build is preferred because a
#    statically linked musl binary resolves users and groups through musl's
#    own minimal NSS: it reads /etc/passwd and /etc/group directly and cannot
#    consult nsswitch.conf modules (LDAP, SSSD, systemd-userdb).  That would
#    silently change the output of `uu-ls -l`, `uu-id` and `uu-chown` on hosts
#    with networked accounts.  Verified glibc floors (objdump -T):
#       x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu -> GLIBC_2.39
#       i686-unknown-linux-gnu   -> GLIBC_2.18
#    Re-check those on a bump; if the floor ever exceeds the oldest glibc in
#    ::gentoo, switch that arch over to its musl tarball.
#
# 3) Where the applet list, the man pages and the completions come from:
#    up to 0.11.0 upstream published an architecture independent docs.tar.zst
#    next to the binaries, and this ebuild derived everything from it.  0.12.0
#    dropped that asset; instead every release tarball now ships a second
#    binary, "uudoc", which prints a man page or a completion script for any
#    applet on stdout.  So the payload itself is the source of truth here, and
#    `coreutils --list` is the applet list.  Consequence: the build host must
#    be able to EXECUTE the target binary, which rules out cross-arch builds;
#    src_install dies with an explicit message when that is the case.  One
#    name in --list is not installed: "stdbuf" needs libstdbuf.so in libexec,
#    which the release tarballs do not ship.
#
# 4) Why the completion files are rewritten with sed:
#    upstream generates them for the unprefixed command name ("#compdef ls",
#    "complete -F _ls ... ls") and merely renames the file to uu-ls.  That
#    registers the completion against GNU ls instead of uu-ls.  The seds below
#    retarget them at the installed name.  This is a deliberate improvement
#    over upstream's own install rule, not an oversight.
#
# 5) l10n: translations live in the source tree, not in the binary tarballs.
#    Release builds look them up at <prefix>/share/locales/<applet>, i.e. the
#    very path the source ebuild installs to -- verified at runtime by running
#    the shipped binary against a synthetic prefix.  en-US is compiled into the
#    binary, so only the extra locales are installed.  0.10.0 ships fr-FR only.
