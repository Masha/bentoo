DESCRIPTION="Dependency manager for PHP"
HOMEPAGE="https://getcomposer.org/ https://github.com/composer/composer"
# The release phar bundles every dependency from upstream's composer.lock, so
# nothing is fetched at build time. getcomposer.org serves the same bytes as
# the GitHub release asset.
SRC_URI="https://getcomposer.org/download/${PV}/${PN}.phar -> ${P}.phar"
S="${WORKDIR}"

# Composer and almost all bundled libraries are MIT; marc-mabe/php-enum is
# BSD-3-Clause and composer/ca-bundle ships Mozilla's cacert.pem (MPL-2.0).
LICENSE="MIT BSD MPL-2.0"
SLOT="0"
# A phar is PHP code, not architecture-specific.
KEYWORDS="~amd64 ~arm ~arm64 ~loong ~ppc ~ppc64 ~riscv ~sparc ~x86"

# composer.json requires ext-filter, ext-hash and ext-json (the last two are
# always built into PHP 8). ssl is required in practice: without ext-openssl
# every download aborts unless the user sets the unsafe disable-tls option.
# ext-curl, ext-zip and ext-zlib are upstream "suggest" entries, see
# pkg_postinst.
