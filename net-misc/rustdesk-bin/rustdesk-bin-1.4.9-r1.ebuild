	# Gating this call is sufficient, which is not obvious given the `cp -a`
	# above copies the whole .deb payload. Measured on the 1.4.9 x86_64
	# payload (re-checked 2026-08-08): its only .service file is the SOURCE
	# named here, usr/share/rustdesk/files/systemd/rustdesk.service. systemd
	# does not read /usr/share, so no active unit path is populated by the
	# payload itself, and ./etc holds only pam.d and rustdesk config.
	# RE-CHECK THIS AFTER A VERSION BUMP: the payload layout is upstream's to
	# change, and a unit appearing under ./etc or ./usr/lib would defeat the
	# gate silently.
	#
	# That source file stays under /usr/share with USE=-systemd. It is inert
	# there and is deliberately left in place: excising one file would mean
	# special-casing the verbatim payload copy this ebuild exists to preserve.
