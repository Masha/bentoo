# Upstream renamed every Linux asset at the 4.0.0 stable release:
#   beta   tag Audacity-4.0.0-beta-4  file Audacity-4.0.0-beta4-x86_64.AppImage
#   stable tag Audacity-4.0.0         file audacity-linux-4.0.0-x86_64.AppImage
# Only the stable scheme is expressed here. A future pre-release must have its
# own derivation checked against the actual release assets -- the two schemes
# agree on nothing, not even the capitalisation, so it cannot be extrapolated.

# 4.0.0 is the first release with an official aarch64 AppImage. Verified to be
# structurally identical to the x86_64 one (same layout, same set of external
# NEEDED entries, only the ELF interpreter differs).
KEYWORDS="-* ~amd64 ~arm64"
RESTRICT="bindist mirror strip"

QA_PREBUILT="*"

# Measured on the 4.0.0 payload, by walking every bundled ELF and keeping the
# NEEDED entries that resolve outside lib/ and fallback/. Qt6, wxWidgets, the
# codec stack, krb5, harfbuzz and freetype are all bundled and must NOT be
# listed here -- an earlier revision of this ebuild depended on expat, freetype
# and zlib, none of which the payload actually resolves from the system.
#
#   libX11 / libX11-xcb ... main binary + plugins/platforms/libqxcb.so
#   libxcb ............... plugins/platforms/libqxcb.so
#   libwayland-{client,egl} plugins/platforms/libqwayland.so and friends
#   libglib-2.0 et al .... libQt6Core / libQt6Gui / libQt6XcbQpa
#   libfontconfig ........ libQt6Gui
#   libEGL/libGL/libGLX/libOpenGL  libQt6Gui + the GL integration plugins
#   libasound ............ main binary
#   libcom_err ........... bundled libkrb5, reached from libQt6Network via the
#                          bundled libgssapi_krb5 -- a hard load-time edge
#   libdbus-1 ............ libQt6DBus, see the removal in src_install below
#
# Deliberately absent: x11-libs/gtk+:3, needed only by the optional
# plugins/platformthemes/libqgtk3.so, which Qt loads under GNOME and otherwise
# never touches; and dev-libs/nss plus dev-db/sqlite, reachable only through
# the bundled fallback/libnss3.so, which AppRun loads only when the system has
# no libnss3 of its own.
